RaspberryPy
===========

A Pythonic environment for learning Python on the RaspberryPi device.

See http://www.raspberrypi.org/ for details of the device.

NB: This software is in no way official or affiliated with the RaspberryPi
project. It's just a quick hack to see how much can be done in as little time
as possible at PyconUK 2011.
